"""Clojure language surface: delimiter and literal verdicts in pure Python.

This is the half of the Clojure surface that does not need a JVM. It scans
Clojure, ClojureScript and EDN text for unbalanced delimiters and unterminated
literals, which is what the write gate must catch before a patch lands.
Formatting, linting, tests, the nREPL and delimiter repair stay with Vis' Clojure
pack, where the JVM tools live.

A file of the same name in `~/.vis/extensions/` or `<project>/.vis/extensions/`
replaces this one.
