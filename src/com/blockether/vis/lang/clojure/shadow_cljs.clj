(ns com.blockether.vis.lang.clojure.shadow-cljs
  "shadow-cljs as the ClojureScript TEST RUNNER: which build runs the tests, how
   THIS machine invokes shadow-cljs, and the exact argv that runs a narrowed
   selection. A `*_test.cljs` never loads on the JVM, so `clojure -M:test` can no
   more run it than `node` can run a `.clj` — the build is not a preference here,
   it is the only runtime that exists.

   Three facts decide the command, and each has its own honest refusal instead of
   a guess:

   1. HOW shadow-cljs is installed. `node_modules/.bin/shadow-cljs` (npm) wins
      because it is what the project's own `npm test` runs; a
      `thheller/shadow-cljs` dependency in `deps.edn` runs as
      `clojure -M[:alias] -m shadow.cljs.devtools.cli` — the SAME project may
      carry it either way, and an alias-only dependency needs that alias on the
      command line or the classpath lacks the namespace being `-m`'d. Declared in
      `package.json` but not installed is answered as `npm install`, not as
      \"no ClojureScript runner\".
   2. WHICH build runs tests. Resolve an explicit build or the sole test build;
      never guess between suites. :node-test runs headless, :karma drives its
      own browser, and :browser-test needs a browser RUNTIME that this runner
      cannot supply. Compiling alone is never evidence of passing tests.
   3. WHAT the run is narrowed to. `--config-merge` carries namespace focus and
      disables Node autorun. Compile first, then run Node separately: shadow's
      autorun does not propagate the child exit status. Print overrides with
      `pr-str`; hand-built regexp escapes can make shadow print help and exit
      ZERO without compiling anything."
