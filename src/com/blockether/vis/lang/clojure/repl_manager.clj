  "Owned, session-scoped nREPL lifecycle for the Clojure pack.

   OWNERSHIP: each vis SESSION owns its own nREPL subprocess(es). The `processes`
   atom is keyed by `[session-id dir]`, so two sessions in the same directory get
   two independent REPLs and neither can see or stop the other's. A managed REPL
   lives and dies with THIS vis process — there is NO persistent registry and NO
   PID re-attach across a vis restart. Restarting vis means a fresh REPL, exactly
   like the Python pack.

   PORT: we PICK a free ephemeral port ourselves and pass it to the launcher
   EXPLICITLY (`nrepl.cmdline --port N`, `lein repl :headless :port N`,
   `bb nrepl-server N`), so we always KNOW our port without ever reading a
   `.nrepl-port` file back. Any stray `.nrepl-port` a tool drops in the project is
   deleted after boot — vis never depends on it and never leaves it behind.

   ALIASES: a REPL is ALWAYS booted with the project's `:dev :test` deps + paths
   on its classpath (full dependency spec), with the user's `:main-opts` dropped
   (our synthetic `:vis/nrepl-launch` alias appends last so `-m nrepl.cmdline`
   wins). Unknown `:dev`/`:test` aliases are silently ignored by tools.deps, so
   this is safe in any project.

   ATTACHMENTS: `connect!` registers an EXTERNAL nREPL the user already runs in a
   SEPARATE `attachments` atom, never in `processes`. They are different kinds:
   one is a process we own and must eventually kill, the other is an address we
   were invited to use. Keeping them apart is what lets ONE project have both at
   once — the managed JVM REPL `repl start` booted for its `.clj`, and the
   shadow-cljs nREPL its own `watch` runs for the `.cljs` — instead of the second
   `connect` answering \"already-running\" about the first and handing back a JVM
   REPL nobody asked for.

   Starting/stopping is CORE and ALWAYS allowed — never gated behind a flag."

     `repl_eval` lands in that build's JS runtime instead of the JVM the very same
     server also serves. With no `:port`, the port is read from the project's own
     `.shadow-cljs/nrepl.port` — the file that watch published, under the dir the
     caller named.
   - The address is PROBED first (bounded): a dead host:port is REFUSED
     (\"unreachable\") instead of registered.
   - An attachment is INDEPENDENT of the MANAGED REPL for the same dir: both stay
     live, each under its own id. A second connect for the same dir REPLACES the
     attachment (\"reconnected\"), so changing build or port needs no detach.
   - `stop!` / `detach!` on it only detaches.

   Every refusal names what to run next: \"no-port\", \"unreachable\",
   \"not-shadow\" (a plain JVM nREPL has no build to select), \"unknown-build\"
   (with the ids that server loaded), \"no-watch\" (a build's REPL needs its
   RUNNING worker), \"select-failed\". Model-facing: STRING keys + STRING enums."
