  "The `:general` lint provider: Clojure COMPILER warnings — reflection and
   boxed math.

   Unlike clj-kondo (static analysis over source text), these warnings only
   exist at COMPILE time: the compiler emits them while it resolves interop /
   code. So this provider COMPILES whatever the lint TARGETS — a `lint_code` code
   string, or each source file being linted — in a throwaway namespace that is
   torn down afterwards, so the running system is never mutated and nothing leaks.

   It compiles the code in a throwaway namespace with `*warn-on-reflection*` and
   `*unchecked-math* :warn-on-boxed` bound, captures the compiler's `*err*`
   stream, and parses each warning line

     `Boxed math warning, <file>:<row>:<col> - <message>`

   A lint target is usually the source of a namespace that is ALREADY LOADED in
   this JVM. Its `ns`/`in-ns` form must still evaluate — the `:require`s are what
   let the rest of the file resolve — but evaluating it verbatim switches `*ns*`
   to the live namespace, and every `defn` in the file then REDEFINES that
   namespace's vars from the linted bytes. Linting a file was therefore enough
   to reload it: an editor-stale or half-written buffer would quietly replace
   the running code. Renaming the namespace keeps the requires and drops the
   definitions into a throwaway namespace that [[compute-findings]] deletes."

   This is the whole safety property of this provider. Lint targets are arbitrary
   files — build scripts, `bb` scripts, `deps.edn`-adjacent tooling — and a script
   is written to DO its work when loaded. Loading `scripts/gen-audit.bb` (whose
   last top-level form is `(System/exit 0)`) inside the gateway JVM shut the
   daemon down and cancelled every running session on the host; that is what this
   rewrite exists to prevent.

   Definitions ([[definition-heads]]) pass through, with `ns`/`in-ns` redirected
   to `shadow` (see [[shadowed]]). `def`/`defonce` become an unbound `def` plus
   their initializer under a `fn`. Anything else — a bare call, a `let` runner, a
   `(System/exit 0)` — is wrapped in `(fn [] …)`: the compiler walks the body and

(defn- compile-forms!
  "Read `code` form by form (line/column metadata intact, so warning rows keep
   pointing at the real source) and compile each through [[compilable]], with the
   target's own namespace redirected to `shadow`. Reading is `*read-eval*`-free:
   `#=(…)` must not run either. One unreadable or uncompilable form ends/skips
   that form only — the warnings already emitted are kept, exactly as a partially
   compiling file behaved before.

   ANALYSED, not evaluated. Reflection and boxed-math warnings are emitted while
   the compiler RESOLVES a form, so `Compiler/analyze` reports them in full: on a
   file of 60 warning-producing defns both routes return the same 180 findings,
   warning for warning and column for column. What `eval` additionally did was
   generate the bytecode and load it through a fresh `DynamicClassLoader` — work
   this provider never needed, since it only ever reads the compiler's warnings
   and throws the code away.

   This is a SAFETY and honesty change, not a memory fix, and the numbers say so:
   linting this repo's ten largest internal namespaces loads 23 139 classes
   analysed against 23 713 evaluated — 2.4%. Nearly all of that is the target's
   own `:require`s being loaded, which compiles those libraries and happens
   either way; the target's own forms were never the expensive part. Repeat lints
   of one file already cost nothing, because the findings cache answers them.

   The value is that arbitrary linted code is no longer EXECUTED to be inspected.
   [[compilable]]'s `(fn [] …)` wrapper made execution unreachable, but analysis
   removes the code path instead of hiding it.

   [[context-heads]] never reach the compiler ([[establish-context!]] applies
   them as function calls); [[value-heads]] are the narrow set that still must be
   evaluated, because analysis interns a var without giving it the value a later
   macro expansion or type reference needs."

   form goes through [[compilable]] first: definitions define, and all other code
   is compiled inside a `fn` that is never called. The target's own `ns` is
   renamed ([[shadowed]]), so its definitions land in a throwaway namespace that
   is dropped here instead of redefining a loaded namespace from the linted
   bytes. A hard compile error yields whatever warnings were emitted before it
   (possibly none) — never throws.

   What the target `require`s is deliberately left loaded. Those libs are now
   registered as loaded whether or not this lint triggered them, and unloading a
   namespace the registry still calls loaded would leave a later `require`
   satisfied by nothing.

   Only warnings the compiler attributes to THIS source are kept. A target's
   `ns`/`require` still loads its dependencies, and loading a library compiles
