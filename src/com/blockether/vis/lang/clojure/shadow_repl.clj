  "shadow-cljs as the ClojureScript REPL RUNTIME: attaching to the nREPL a
   `shadow-cljs watch` already runs, SELECTING the build whose JS runtime an eval
   must land in, and keeping that selection true for every later eval.

   Five facts about that server decide everything here, and every one of them was
   learned from a live shadow-cljs, not from its wire protocol:

   1. A shadow-cljs nREPL is INDISTINGUISHABLE from a plain JVM one over
      `describe`: it advertises no cljs/shadow op and reports only a `:clojure`
      version, so dialect detection from describe metadata answers `:clj` for it.
      The only honest question is a read-only eval that RESOLVES
      `shadow.cljs.devtools.api` inside the server.
   2. The build is selected PER nREPL SESSION — `(shadow…api/nrepl-select :app)` —
      and ONE session serves EVERY build of that server, so a selection belongs
      to the CONNECTION and never to an attachment: selecting `:worker` makes
      the next eval that believes it targets `:app` answer from the worker's
      runtime, silently and with no error. Every eval therefore re-checks both
      the session and the build selected in it, never a boolean.
   3. Selecting from a session ALREADY sitting in a build FAILS — the select form
      is compiled as ClojureScript and dies on `No such namespace:
      shadow.cljs.devtools.api`. `:cljs/quit` first is what makes selection
      total: it returns such a session to CLJ, and in a session that never left
      CLJ it is an ordinary keyword evaluating to itself.
   4. `nrepl-select` answers the SAME `watch for build not running` whether the
      build id does not exist or is merely not being watched. The two are told
      apart BEFORE selecting — by the server's own build config and
      `worker-running?` — because they need opposite fixes.
   5. A selected build with NO connected JS runtime neither errors nor hangs:
      every eval answers `No available JS runtime.` on `:err` with a `done`
      status. Nothing but a started runtime fixes it, so that answer is turned
      into the instruction that starts one."
