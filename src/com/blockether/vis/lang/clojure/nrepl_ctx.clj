  "Per-turn nREPL resource synchronization for the Clojure pack.

   Live state has ONE model-facing home: `repl_status`. This extension hook probes
   owned nREPLs and mirrors them into the generic session resource registry —
   what `repl_status` and the footer answer from; nothing about a resource rides in
   ctx. It returns no legacy `session[\"env\"][\"languages\"]` contribution.

   OWNERSHIP: we surface ONLY the REPLs THIS session started + owns, PLUS any
   external nREPL the user EXPLICITLY attached via `connect` (both from
   `repl-manager/session-repls`). There is still NO external-port discovery and
   no `.nrepl-port` scanning — attachment is explicit consent, never a scan.

   Eval defaults to the workspace-root REPL (else the first) when several exist;
   the result reports which REPL ran. Each mirror carries liveness status and
   diagnostics from a per-turn probe.

   All best-effort: any failure degrades to an empty contribution and never
   blocks the render."
