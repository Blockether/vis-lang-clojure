  "Thin, observable nREPL client for `clj/eval`.

   Connection model:
     * One `nrepl.core/connect` socket per `[host port]` key, cached
       on a `defonce` atom so we survive `(require :reload)` during
       development.
     * ONE long-lived nREPL session per connection, cloned lazily on
       first use and cached beside the socket — then REUSED by every
       `eval!`. This is how Cider/Calva/every editor drives nREPL: no
       per-eval `clone`/`close` round-trip on the hot path (those were
       what blew the `run_tests` budget under JVM load), nothing
       to leak, and session-local state — `*1`/`*2`/`*3`/`*e` and dynamic
       `set!`s — PERSISTS across calls like a real REPL (`(def …)` was
       already global; now the whole session is).
     * Stale / closed sockets are detected (`IOException` / `nil`
       message stream) and the entry is evicted — closing the socket and
       dropping the cached session — so the next call re-dials + re-clones.

   Returned shape (success) — STRING keys (crosses the strings-only boundary
   as a tool `:result`; enrichment adds \"error_message\"/\"error_data\"/\"trace\"):
     {\"value\"      \"42\"          ; pr-str of the LAST form's value, or nil
      \"values\"     [\"1\" \"42\"]   ; pr-str of every emitted value
      \"out\"        \"hello\\n\"     ; stdout aggregated
      \"err\"        \"\"             ; stderr aggregated
      \"ns\"         \"user\"         ; final *ns* name
      \"status\"     #{\"done\"}      ; nREPL status set (strings)
      \"ex\"         nil              ; exception class name, when status :ex
      \"root_ex\"    nil              ; root exception class name
      \"ms\"         12               ; wall-clock duration
      \"port\"       7888
      \"timed_out\" false}

   Failure paths throw `ex-info` with `:type :clj/nrepl-*` so the
   Vis tool wrapper can surface a clean error to the model."
