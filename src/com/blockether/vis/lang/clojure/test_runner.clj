(ns com.blockether.vis.lang.clojure.test-runner
  "Run a namespace's tests in the session's ALREADY-RUNNING nREPL (the fast inner
   loop) or -- the default, and whenever there is no such REPL -- by shelling the
   project's own test command in a clean JVM. Nothing here EVER starts a REPL.

   The in-REPL path is FRAMEWORK-AGNOSTIC: a ns whose vars carry clojure.test
   :test metadata runs through clojure.test/run-tests; otherwise it is treated
   as lazytest and run through lazytest.runner/run-tests. Either way the result
   is a uniform STRING-keyed map (crosses the strings-only boundary) with
   \"mode\" (repl or cli), \"framework\", \"ns\", \"total\", \"pass\", \"fail\" and
   \"failures\" [{\"ns\" \"test\" \"message\" \"file\" \"line\"} ...].
   CLI and shadow-cljs retain complete stdout/stderr in \"output\" (ANSI-stripped)
   and collect per-fault diagnostics before rendering. Only the display preview
   may be bounded; the result data is never reduced to a log tail.

   run-form is the code EVALED on the target nREPL. It is a quoted form (not a
   call into this namespace) so it works against ANY project's nREPL, including
   hosts that do not have the vis-agent extension on their classpath."

  "Code evaled on the target nREPL. Loads each REQUESTED namespace FROM SOURCE

   namespace the caller edited keeps the Vars the REPL already holds and the
   run measures stale code. Reloading those is the caller's move (`repl_eval`
   `(require 'my.prod.ns :reload)`, or a fresh REPL) — never `:reload-all`
   here, which would re-evaluate the whole graph under the test run. Selects
   tests by the lazytest-modeled selector map {:vars :include :exclude} at VAR
   granularity. :vars is what the `<path>::<test-name>` node ids in the CALL's
   :paths resolved to - {:ns <ns-or-nil> :name <name>} - and a name matches the
   test var itself (adds-test) or the SOURCE var it covers (adds), the same
   `-test` translation a SOURCE FILE gets. A non-empty :vars that matches
   NOTHING is an ERROR carrying only the searched namespace and test-var counts,
   never a silent 0/0 pass or an exhaustive list that wastes model context.
   ns-files is an optional map from namespace string to absolute test file path. The map used when the live nREPL was started without test paths on its classpath."

  "Resolve the CALL's selector entries into what a run needs: `:nses`, the test
   namespaces to load, `:vars`, the var filter to apply inside them
   (`{:ns <ns-or-nil> :name <test-name-or-nil>}`), `:files`, the test file each
   NAMESPACE entry resolved to — a path entry already names its own location, a
   namespace entry does not, and the run must still be rooted at the project the
   tests live in — and `:ns-files`, the file EVERY selected namespace was read
   from (nil when the index does not know it), which is what says whether that
   namespace runs on the JVM or in shadow-cljs.
   `path-entries` are the node-id maps from `:paths` (`{:path :var}`, from
   `split-node-id`); `ns-entries` are the namespace/var spellings
   (`{:ns :var}`, from `split-selector-entry`).
   Each entry is resolved ON ITS OWN, so `a_test.clj::x` and `b_test.clj::y`
   pair each name with its OWN file instead of cross-producting into both. An
   entry with no location (`::x`, or a bare `only` name) names a var wherever it
   lives — nil :ns, and no namespace of its own, so the other entries (or the
   whole-workspace default) decide where to look and remain narrowed by that name.
   A nil :name with a namespace preserves a whole-file selection alongside scoped
   vars. Paths are relative to root or absolute; files AND directories are accepted,
   and SOURCE files/dirs map to their *_test namespaces."

   Missing paths and explicit-but-empty selections fail instead of running all.

   The files and an optional build choose the runtime. .cljs cannot run on the
   JVM, .clj cannot run in JS, and .cljc can accompany either. An explicit build
   selects JS for shared tests. Mixed JVM/JS selections are refused, never
   silently trimmed. The nearest project manifest roots the command.

   No REPL is started: reuse this session's JVM REPL or shell an executable
   project runner. aliases add classpath or select that runner. Lazytest/Kaocha
   receive their own focus arguments; unsupported focus fails before launch.
   A reused REPL cannot apply aliases and says so. JS uses the project's own
   shadow launcher/config; no shadow dependency is loaded into Vis. JS var/tag
   selectors are refused instead of widened to namespace runs.

   An unfiltered CLI run leaves suite discovery to the project runner/build;
   local filename discovery does not override its configured suite. A reused
   REPL still uses the local index, loading only the test namespaces (callers
   must reload changed production dependencies or stop that REPL themselves).
   CLI verdicts require nonempty test summaries; selected is the executed test
   count, while ns/command identify effective focus. Language stays clojure."
