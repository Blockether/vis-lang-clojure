  "clj-kondo linting for the Vis language surface.

   Runs clj-kondo's programmatic API (`clj-kondo.core/run!`) — never shells out —
   over a code string (fed on stdin as `-`), explicit path(s), or the workspace's
   default source paths, and returns a uniform result map (STRING keys — crosses
   the strings-only boundary as a tool `:result`):
   `{\"op\" \"clj-lint\" \"error\" N \"warning\" N \"info\" N \"files\" N \"findings\" [...]}`
   where each finding is `{\"file\" \"row\" \"col\" \"level\" \"type\" \"message\" \"provider\"}`
   (every finding names clj-kondo as its provider).

   Resolve the analyzer on the first lint request, not when a language pack is
   registered: non-Clojure sessions do not need its compiler and analysis tables.")
