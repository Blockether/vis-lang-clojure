  "Config-driven Clojure source formatter used by `clj/edit` for format-on-write
   and by the `format_code` language-surface verb.

   TWO backends live here, and the choice is TRANSPARENT to the language
   surface — callers just format; this namespace picks the formatter from the
   config files present around the target path:

     * zprint  — when a `.zprint.edn`/`.zprintrc` is found walking UP from the
                 path. The project's zprint options map is applied. This is the
                 canonical, reflowing formatter — for this repo it is THE
                 formatter, applied through the repo's own `.zprint.edn`.
     * cljfmt  — when only a `.cljfmt.edn`/`.cljfmt.clj` is found (no zprint), or
                 when neither config exists (cljfmt defaults). Conservative:
                 normalizes indentation + whitespace of MULTI-LINE forms but does
                 NOT reflow a one-liner into multiple lines.

   When BOTH configs are present, zprint WINS. Backends and their config loaders
   are resolved on first use, not while registering the language pack at gateway
   startup. Registering formatting handlers does not need either implementation.

   Failure mode: if a backend refuses (parse error, unfamiliar reader macro,
   anything that throws), the formatter returns the original source unchanged.
   We never silently corrupt a file because the formatter choked."
