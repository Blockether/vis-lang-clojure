     \"start\"   — start a project nREPL subprocess (always allowed)
     \"stop\"    — stop a Vis-managed nREPL / DETACH an external one (always allowed)

                 later repl_eval reuses, so the eval lands in its JS runtime. With

                 ClojureScript attach never costs you the JVM REPL.

   \"cwd\" runs the REPL in a subdir (e.g. an extension) instead of the workspace
   root — that's how MULTIPLE REPLs coexist, each addressed by its id. \"aliases\"
